#The dataset includes the following files:

- 'README.md' - This file.

- 'CodeBook.md': Shows information about the variables, the data, and applied transformations. The variables and data discussed in this file can be found in 'tidy_DF.txt', whereas the trnsformation from raw-date to tidy data are handled by the r Script 'run_analysis.R'.

- 'run_analysis.R': An R script that can be executed in the directory having Samsung data to produce a tidy dataset. This script does not need any parameters to be set for execution. The raw-data should be uncompressed, so that the script is in a directory having "UCI HAR Dataset" as a subdirectory.

- 'tidy_DF.txt': The tidy dataset produced by 'run_analysis.R'. This file will be automatically generated in the directory where the 'run_analysis.R' script was executed.
